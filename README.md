This is a random code I made in the middle 2 AM to be able to generate a random chaotic number between two variables. This code has no purpose. It my daily way to assert intellectual quirk over nobody. :D

It is called, CIFRE (Chaotic Inverse Fractional Reverse Exponential) _im too creative with the name_

Can be represented as:
$$\zeta(a,b) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\frac{a_{2(i-1)}}{b_{2(i-1)}}\right)^{-\frac{b}{a}}, \quad b_0 = \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{\frac{b}{a}}, \quad a_0 = b_0^{-1}$$
